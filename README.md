This program checks graph properties in a .txt format including: <br />
getRoots() - calculates the root verticies of the graph <br />
isReflexive() - checks if the graph is reflexive <br />
isSymmetric() - checks if the graph is symmetric <br />
isTransitive() - checks if the graph is transitive <br />
isAntiSymmetric() - checks if the graph is anti-symmetric <br />
isEquivalence() - checks if the graph is an equivalence relation <br />
getEquivalenceClass(vertex) - calculates the equivalence class of the given vertex

as well as: <br />
iterativeBreadthFirstSearch() - performs an iterative breadth-first search on the graph <br />
iterativeDepthFirstSearch() - performs an iterative depth-first search on the graph

or alternatively: <br />
recursiveBreadthFirstSearch() - performs a recursive breadth-first search on the graph <br />
recursiveDepthFirstSearch() - performs a recursive depth-first search on the graph <br />
