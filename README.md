This program checks graph properties in a .txt format including: \n
getRoots() - calculates the root verticies of the graph \n
isReflexive() - checks if the graph is reflexive \n
isSymmetric() - checks if the graph is symmetric \n
isTransitive() - checks if the graph is transitive \n
isAntiSymmetric() - checks if the graph is anti-symmetric \n
isEquivalence() - checks if the graph is an equivalence relation \n
getEquivalenceClass(vertex) - calculates the equivalence class of the given vertex

as well as:
iterativeBreadthFirstSearch() - performs an iterative breadth-first search on the graph
iterativeDepthFirstSearch() - performs an iterative depth-first search on the graph

or alternatively: 
recursiveBreadthFirstSearch() - performs a recursive breadth-first search on the graph
recursiveDepthFirstSearch() - performs a recursive depth-first search on the graph
